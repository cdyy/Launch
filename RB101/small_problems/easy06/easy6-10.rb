# Right Triangles
# Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

# Examples:

# triangle(5)

#     *
#    **
#   ***
#  ****
# *****

# triangle(9)

#         *
#        **
#       ***
#      ****
#     *****
#    ******
#   *******
#  ********
# *********

def triangle(n)
  stars = 1
  spaces = n - 1

  n.times do |i|
    puts " " * spaces + "*" * stars
    stars += 1
    spaces -= 1
  end
end
