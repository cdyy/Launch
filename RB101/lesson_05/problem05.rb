Practice Problem 5
Given this nested Hash:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}
figure out the total age of just the male members of the family.

#select the pairs with gender as male
age = munsters.select{ |key, value| value["gender"] == "male" }
